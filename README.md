# Dormitory-Management-System

It is a desktop application for University Dormitory to keep track of the residents, facilities and activities

within the dormitory. Created backend database functionality with MySQL for the database. Created

in Java, Java FX UI, with business logic and data repository.  Used GitHub to integrate all modules into a complete application.
